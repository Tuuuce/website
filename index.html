        <h2>WHO AM I?</h2>
        <p> 
                After studied Business Administration, I moved to Istanbul and lived there for 9 years. In Istanbul I worked in two
                different Social Media / Digital Marketing Agencies and managed some big brands social media accounts. Last 4 years
                in Istanbul I was working as a Digital Communications Consultant of the biggest private bank of Turkey, Turkiye Ä°s
                Bankasi. 3,5 years ago I got a job offer from Teleperformance Greece and I moved to Athens. I worked as a Social
                Media Content Moderator for Facebook there. Because of my husband's job we moved to London and I don't look for a
                new job. I decided to follow my dreams for becoming a Web Developer. <br> <br>
                I like movies, photography, cooking and playing tennis. <br> <br>

        <h2> WHY AM I APPLYING FOR THE PROGRAMME?</h2>
        <p>
                One day I wanted to learn something new and started an online course. After I learned some HTML, CSS and Java Script, I
                decided on my new career path. I was really into this field. Even though I was at the beginning, I had the desire to
                produce big projects. With Founders and Coders I can do more than any online course. Being in touch with people and
                exchanging knowledge is something very important in the learning process for me. My only dream is being an expert in
                Javascript. I set some ambitious goals for myself and I want to reach my full potential with you. I would like to be a
                part of this life changing experience.
